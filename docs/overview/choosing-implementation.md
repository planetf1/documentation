# Choosing an ML-KEM implementation

The PQ Code Package offers a variety of different implementations of ML-KEM.

These vary in certain characteristics in terms of:

* Code Audits
* Formal verification
* Platform specific optimizations (memory, cpu, ...)
* Implementation Language

Additionally as sub-projects onboard to pq-code-package they will go through a variety of stages before being ready to use .
